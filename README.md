## State Management

Implementing effective state management, especially with complex data structures, posed challenges initially. Leveraging React's Context API and custom hooks helped streamline this process.

## Handling Asynchronous Operations

Managing asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from APIs and updating the UI accordingly, required careful handling to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.

## Error Handling

Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful feedback to users in case of failures or unexpected behavior was crucial yet challenging.
