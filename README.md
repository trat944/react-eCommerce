**Challenges Faced**

State Management: Implementing effective state management, especially with complex data structures, posed challenges initially. Leveraging React's Context API and custom hooks helped streamline this process.

Handling Asynchronous Operations: Managing asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from APIs and updating the UI accordingly, required careful handling to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.

Styling and Layout: Achieving the desired styling and layout design, especially for responsive views, required meticulous attention to detail and CSS/SCSS skills.

Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful feedback to users in case of failures or unexpected behavior was crucial yet challenging.
